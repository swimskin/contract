#Solidity contract for [Swim.skin](https://swim.skin)

## OpenZeppelin based, but modified
The base of the [Swim.skin](https://swim.skin) contract is the set of OpenZeppelin ERC721 libraries, which have been heavily modified for our needs.

## Lowest gas fees
We are confident that our modifications yield the lowest possible gas fees. We are banking on our contract being at par with or better than ERC721a.
